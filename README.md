# NG_Project_Turtle_Tech_DAQ
JMU engineering project in collaboration with Northrop Grumman which tracks turtle migration using smart buoys. This repository showcases the DAQ system.
The system was run on a raspberry pi 4 and was implemented inside a buoy structure. Each sensor collected data and stored it in a mysql table. The data was sent from the tables by the communications team via radio to other buoys. The table below is the mysql table is the output of the GPS code.
